# Overview

This an **experimental** Hyperledger Sawtooth network orchestrator intended primarily to verify assumptions about its technical and code architecture. For example, to conduct experiment like the use of Docker sdk to enable the orchestrator to integrate with Docker based deployment; what would that take to make it work.

This is **NOT** a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It is not the intention of this project to identify if a feature is viable from a useability and/or commerical perspective. Some of the features you find here may be in various stages of usability and are not necessarily bug-free.

This project is develop as open source to sought feedback about technology used to create the orchestrator or to sought code contribution to demonstrate technical concepts. 

Feedback about the useability or look and feel of the project is also welcomed but it is not the primary focus.

This project is **NOT** is not intended for any mission critical environment. 

## What technology will I find in this project?

The orchestator will used the following based line technologies:

* ReactJS based framework to faciltate experimentation for integration between UI and backend;
* Go based backend to faciltate experimentation related to cross platform deployment of orchestrator and orchestrator Docker integration.

However, it may expand over time.

## If I find this project useful ...

Please clone **NOT** forked the project and maintain it separate from this repo. This is project is not accompanied with any support services.
