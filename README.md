# Overview

This an **experimental** Hyperledger Sawtooth network orchestrator intended primarily to verify assumptions about its technical and code architecture. In other words, this project is to address the questions such as: 

* If I wanted this feature what would it take to make it work?
* Is there a better way of implementing this feature?

This is **NOT** a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This project's intention is *not* to determine if a feature is viable from a useability and/or commerical perspective. Some of the features you find here may be in various stages of usability and are not necessarily bug-free. They maybe removed without notice and is definitely *not* for any mission critical deployment.

This project is develop as opened-source to sought feedback about technology used to create the orchestrator or to sought code contribution to demonstrate technical concepts. Feedback about the useability or look and feel of the project is also welcomed but it is not the primary focus.

## What technology will I find in this project?

The orchestator will used the following based line technologies:

* ReactJS based framework to faciltate experimentation for integration between UI and backend;
* Go based backend to faciltate experimentation related to cross platform deployment of orchestrator and orchestrator Docker integration.

However, it may expand over time.

## If I find this project useful ...

Please clone **NOT** forked the project and maintain it separate from this repo. This is project is not accompanied with any support services.
